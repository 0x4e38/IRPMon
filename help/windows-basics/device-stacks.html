<h1>Device Stacks</h1>
<p>
So far, you got familiar with the concepts of driver and device entities in the WIndows kernel and how kernel components and user applications can communicate with each other. You know that when an application or a driver wish to communicate with another driver, it just opens one of its devices, suitable for the communication, and starts sending requests to it. But what to do when a driver  needs to monitor or filter requests targetted at a device associated with another driver? Such need may be absolutely legit, for example when a disk encryption driver needs to encrypt and decrypt data passing through a disk device. Windows kernel solves this problem by introducing <i>device stacks</i>.
