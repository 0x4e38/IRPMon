<h1>Watching PnP Drivers</h1>
<p>
IRPMon allows the user also to monitor PnP drivers that are not present in the kernel at the moment (e.g. because there are no devices for them to control). To automatically monitor such a driver, the user has to know its name and devices of which device setup class the driver serves. IRPMon then installs itself as a filter driver for that class to be notified when a new device belonging to the class is connected to the system, which usually means that the driver of interest is being loaded.
